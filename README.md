# Furniverse²²⁵
## The Multimodal Digital Furnishing Dataset
**Furniverse²²⁵** is an extensive database of pictures of 225 digital furnishing objects, combined with textual descriptions in the German language.

For each object, we automatically generate screenshots from multiple angles which we present to our annotators. The annotators then write one literal, and one sentimental description for each object.
